## Week 1

High level summary of what has been covered in each session.

### Day 1: QUBITS & QUANTUM STATES, CIRCUITS, MEASUREMENTS
Introduced the topic of Quantum Computing (QC) and highlighted the fundamental differences between QC and Classical Computing by focusing on the bits vs qubits and computational complexities. Dirac Notation was also introduced and basic operations of linear algebra - inner, outer, tensor products - were explained through the bra-ket notation. Concepts of measurement, Born rule and the bloch sphere were also touched upon. Quantum Circuits were later introduced and important gates (CNOT, Hadamard, Pauli) were explained. Multipartite quantum states and entagled states were breifly explained. Entaglement was explained in more details using Bell states, the lecture was concluded by walking through an instance of Quantum Teleportation and Q spheres.

## Final Project:

**Deadline:** Aug 7th, 2020 (10:00am EDT)

In the Final Project we will design, implement, and simulate a VQE algorithm for calculating the ground state energy of the LiH molecule. We will explore different choices of designing VQE algorithms and compare their performance under specified assumptions to each other and to the classically computed exact solution. In addition, we will look at how realistic device specific noises could impact the performance of VQE algorithms. 

When designing an algorithm to be run on an actual quantum computer, there are a lot of variables to consider and the choices you make for the algorithm could dynamically change given different hardware specifications. Therefore there is no right answer for how you should design your algorithm. The goal of this project is for you to understand the different components that comprise a VQE algorithm and showcase your understanding by comparing the performance of different algorithm instances.
